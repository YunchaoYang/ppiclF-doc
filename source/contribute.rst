Contributing
============

Workflow
^^^^^^^^
In order to contribute to ppiclF, a fork/branch workflow is used. First, `ppiclF <https://github.com/dpzwick/ppiclF>`_ must be forked to your personal github account.

When additions are made to ppiclF, a pull request can be issued. `Travis <https://travis-ci.org>`_ will then run through unit tests to make sure that your additions have not broken the core code functionality. An administrator of ppiclF will then only approve your pull request if the unit tests succeed.

Issues
^^^^^^
Issues can be submitted through the `issues tab <https://github.com/dpzwick/ppiclF/issues>`_ on the main github page.
